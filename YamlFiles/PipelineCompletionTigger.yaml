# a pipeline resource trigger so that a pipeline named app-ci runs after any run of the security-lib-ci pipeline completes
# security-lib-ci - This pipeline runs first

# security-lib-ci YAML pipeline
steps:
- bash: echo "The security-lib-ci pipeline runs first"

# app-ci - This pipeline has a pipeline resource trigger that configures the app-ci pipeline to run automatically every time a run of the security-lib-ci pipeline completes

# app-ci YAML pipeline
# We are setting up a pipeline resource that references the security-lib-ci
# pipeline and setting up a pipeline completion trigger so that our app-ci
# pipeline runs when a run of the security-lib-ci pipeline completes
resources:
  pipelines:
  - pipeline: securitylib # Name of the pipeline resource.
    source: security-lib-ci # The name of the pipeline referenced by this pipeline resource.
    project: FabrikamProject # Required only if the source pipeline is in another project
    trigger: true # Run app-ci pipeline when any run of security-lib-ci completes

steps:
- bash: echo "app-ci runs after security-lib-ci completes"

You can optionally specify the branches to include or exclude when configuring the trigger. If you specify branch filters, a new pipeline is triggered whenever a source pipeline run is successfully completed that matches the branch filters. In the following example, the app-ci pipeline runs if the security-lib-ci completes on any releases/* branch, except for releases/old*
# app-ci YAML pipeline
resources:
  pipelines:
  - pipeline: securitylib
    source: security-lib-ci
    trigger: 
      branches:
        include: 
        - releases/*
        exclude:
        - releases/old*
